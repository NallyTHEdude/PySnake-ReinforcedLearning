# Python Snake game AI using reinforced learning

* CREDITS TO ---> https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp 
* A very heartly thanks to freecodecamp for letting me learn from this project for free.
* This project uses the bellman equation for reinforced learning.
* this is not a perfect project , the snake gets stuck in its own body loop. sometimes , and i dont know how to approach to fix it.
* install the required pip packages.
* RUN THE "agent.py" file.
* observe that after each game the ai gets better and better , also observer your console to keep a track of global highest score and the highest score of the current game , you will see that the ai tries to beat its own highest score.
